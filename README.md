# Welcome to Rhys Cabot's Fall 2025 Semester Capstone Project!

This semester has been a wild ride, and admittedly my project has been...bumpy. But I am nonetheless excited to share what I could salvage out of this challenging, shaky experience. Especially when going it alone, but I am at least glad I got to challenge myself!

# Title

Addressing Broken Sentence Structure in Japanese to English Machine Translation

## Abstract

In the field of machine translation research, by virtue of the range of possible pairings, not every language pair is given much attention in regards to specific pairing issues. The emphasis of MT research is usually on large-scale improvement and change across an array of languages. For this project, I chose to narrow my focus to Japanese and English translation and target an especially common grammatical issue that I believed plagued translation results too frequently. During the project, I attempted to work through considerable technical limitations to engineer a solution that would make broken machine translations less of a hinderance on professional translators. The project eventually narrowed to applying extensive post-processing to machine translation outputs in order to aid with formatting broken translations, particularly ones that suffer from the grammatical differences between English and Japanese in regards to sentence structure.

## Instructions

The source code can be found in the FinalDemoSourceCode.ipynb. You'll need to import the two files in the data subfolder if you want to run the code in there though, just importing them on Google Colab or another virtual environment that allows for data imports should be enough. The subfolder is compressed as the training data is too large to commit to Github otherwise, so make sure you unzip the folder first!

Since this is a research project, the source code is moreso meant to be looked at than create a full user experience. I've included markdown logs to help explain the process, similar to my demo presentation. The emphasis here is moreso on the report, where I go over the long, bumpy process of this undergoing in more detail, and go over some of my findings and propositions. (This is also why the repository lacks a user manual, there isn't a lot to say about how to "use" my research, especially given the limited results.)

That said I did create a second file as a tool to play with my translation guide idea, if you want to experiment with that some. Check out Translation_Guide_Tool in your Jupyter environment of choice to get started! Just edit the string in the second block and click run all to get started!
