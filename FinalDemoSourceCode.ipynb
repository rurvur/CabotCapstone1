        "In this demo I'll show you my working model, and some of the steps I've taken toa ttempt to improve the issue I identified. Said issue is the fact that because Japanese usually follows a rigid SOV sentence order, and English ordinarily uses SVO, sometimes machine translation, since it is focused on accuracy, will mess up the sentence structure. This is especially common when using conversation-level text, and when using weaker models. (Particularly non-neural models, like the one we use today.)"
